# Folders

Create nested folders from your tags with easy drag and drop. Folders also supports Smart Tags, which allow you to build custom filters for viewing your notes.

## Setup

Run `npm install` (for dependencies) and `grunt` (to build).

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.standardnotes.org/extensions/local-setup) to setup the extension locally. Make sure the `area` is set to `tags-list`.
